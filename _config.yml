about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Dongguk University, 
  under the supervision of Professor [Soo-chul Lim](http://irobot.dgu.edu/wordpress/member/professor/). 
  I received my M.S. degree in Science from the same university.

  My research interests include robotics, AI learning, and interaction forces between robots, objects, and humans.
  My ultimate goal is to develop robust robot behaviors and planning by integrating haptics, and to apply 
  these advances to humanoid robotic systems that can interact in a human-like manner.
